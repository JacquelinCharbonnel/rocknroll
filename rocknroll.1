    Light incremental backup tool based on rsync.

    rocknroll --init n tag dstdir

    rocknroll [options] tag srcdir dstdir

    rocknroll --help

    rocknroll --man

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
    rocknroll backups a remote directories tree srcdir in dstdir onto the
    local host. For this backup, it manages a set of archives, named tag.1,
    tag.2, etc. Using the 'link-dest' option of rsync, it keeps only the
    difference between the different archives.

    A dstdir can contain several tagged sequences of archive. For example, a
    dstdir can contain 2 archive sets named daily.1 daily.2 daily.3 daily.4
    daily.5 daily.6 daily.7 and week.1 week.2 week.3 week.4.

    Before a dstdir can be able to store an archive sequence, it must be
    formatted with the --init option.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
    Almost options can as well be specified into the configuration file.

  [1m-c config_file[0m

    By default, rocknroll.conf is searched in ., @/, @/../etc/, /etc/,
    /etc/rocknroll.d/ and /usr/local/etc, where @ is the directory containing
    the rocknroll binary.
